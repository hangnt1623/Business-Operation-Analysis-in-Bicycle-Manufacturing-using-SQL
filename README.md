**QUERY 1 - Calculate Quantity of items, Sales value & Order quantity by each Subcategory in L12M**

*Purpose*: Evaluate sales performance by Subcategory (volume, revenue, orders) over the last 12 months to identify best-selling product groups and guide inventory, marketing, and sales strategy

```sql
SELECT    
    Format_date('%b %Y', detail.ModifiedDate) as period
    ,subcate.Name
    ,sum(OrderQty) as count_items
    ,count(distinct detail.SalesOrderID) as count_orders
    ,ROUND(sum(LineTotal),2) as sales
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` detail
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` product
    ON detail.ProductID = product.ProductID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` subcate
    ON cast(product.ProductSubcategoryID as int) = subcate.ProductSubcategoryID
WHERE DATE(detail.ModifiedDate) BETWEEN DATE('2013-06-30') AND DATE('2014-06-30')
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 2,1
```

*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings
  + Bikes dominate high sales: In Mar‚ÄìMay 2014, Road, Touring, and Mountain Bikes consistently led in both sales value and order volume, confirming strong seasonal demand in Q2.
  + Low performers are niche accessories: Items like Locks, Fenders, and Tights had minimal sales (‚â§ $100) mostly in mid-2013 to early 2014, showing weak or stagnant movement.
  + Sales spread is wide: The gap between top and bottom performers highlights clear category-level differences in demand and inventory value risk.
- Recommendations**
  + Focus Q2 campaigns on top-selling bike categories to maximize returns during peak season.
  + Review and rationalize underperforming SKUs like Locks and Fenders to reduce deadstock risk.
  + Use subcategory performance trends to guide inventory allocation and prioritize marketing spend by season.

*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings
  + Customer retention sharply drops after the first month, with only a small fraction of customers repurchasing in subsequent months.
  + Some months (e.g., month 1 and 2 cohorts) show a temporary increase in repurchases at month 3, suggesting possible promotional or seasonal effects.
  + Overall, retention beyond month 3 is very low, indicating challenges in maintaining customer loyalty over time.
- Recommendations
  + Develop targeted engagement campaigns within the first 1‚Äì3 months post-purchase to boost early repurchase rates.
  + Analyze and replicate factors driving the month-3 repurchase spike to enhance longer-term retention.
  + Introduce loyalty programs or incentives aimed at sustaining repeat purchases beyond the initial 3 months.

| Seat Stays | 10 | 2011 | 9340 | 4243 | 120.1 |

*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings
  + Hidden Volatility in ‚ÄúBB Ball Bearing‚Äù Inventory
    ++ BB Ball Bearing appears 4 times in the top 5, suggesting it's a critical SKU with extremely unstable stock behavior.
    ++ Massive spikes in July (+144.1%) and October (+116.8%), followed by sharp drops in the next months (‚àí24.7%, ‚àí24.2%).
    ‚Üí This cyclical volatility hints at reactive inventory planning, possibly driven by inconsistent forecasting or sudden demand shifts.
  + Potential Overstock Risk on Seat Stays (Oct)
    ++ Seat Stays shows a sudden +120% surge in stock in October without further context.
    ‚Üí If not aligned with demand, this could indicate overstocking, which ties up working capital and increases carrying costs.
  + Drop after Spike Pattern = Inefficient Replenishment
    ++ The repeated pattern of stock surge ‚Üí sharp drop (seen in BB Ball Bearing) might indicate:
    Overstocking due to panic replenishment
    Then understocking as consumption catches up
    ‚Üí This up-down cycle can create a bullwhip effect across the supply chain.
- Recommendations 
  + Control Replenishment for BB Ball Bearing
    ++ Add BB Ball Bearing to a monitored SKU list.
    ++ Set fluctuation threshold (¬±20%) to trigger review.
    ++ Require demand/sales justification before placing large POs.
  + Set Spike-Then-Drop Alerts
    ++ Implement rule: flag if stock ‚Üë >100% and ‚Üì >20% next month.
    ++ Trigger auto-alerts for Supply/Planning team.
    ++ Investigate cause and adjust reorder strategy if needed.
  + Require Demand Validation for Bulk Stock-Ins
    ++ Ensure all large POs are linked to: Forecast data, Sales campaigns, Confirmed customer orders
  + Add pre-check in PO approval workflow.

| 6 | 2011 | 750 | Road-150 Red, 44 | 23 | 10 | 0.43 |


*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings 
  + Persistent Overstock of Slow-Moving SKUs
    ++ Products like Road-650 Red, 62 maintain extremely high stock-to-sales ratios (up to 56x) consistently from September to November 2011.
    -> This indicates that excess inventory is not being cleared effectively over time, suggesting outdated demand forecasts or insufficient markdown strategies.
  + Ongoing Low Stock Levels on High-Demand SKUs
    ++ Popular items such as Road-650 Black, 62 show low ratios (<0.2) in key months like June and August 2011, implying repeated risk of stockouts during peak demand.
    -> This points to unresolved supply chain or replenishment delays over multiple months.
  + Sustained Variant-Level Imbalance
    ++ Wide disparities in stock-to-sales ratios among similar SKUs across consecutive months reveal a lack of detailed, time-sensitive inventory planning.
    -> This likely causes recurring inefficiencies in how stock is allocated between variants.

- Recommendations
  + Implement Monthly SKU-Level Inventory Reviews: Regularly monitor stock-to-sales ratios for each variant to quickly identify persistent overstock or stockout issues and adjust replenishment plans accordingly.
  + Set Automated Alerts for Extreme Ratio Patterns: Create threshold-based alerts (e.g., ratio >20 for overstock, <0.5 for stockout risk) sustained over multiple months to prompt timely interventions such as promotions or expedited orders.
  + Align Procurement with Rolling Sales Data: Use a rolling 3-month sales average to dynamically guide purchasing decisions, ensuring supply closely matches evolving demand patterns and reducing inventory imbalances.


**QUERY 8 - Number of orders and value at Pending status in 2014**

*Purpose*: Monitor pending orders to uncover process bottlenecks, enhance fulfillment efficiency, and minimize revenue delays or customer dissatisfaction

```sql

```
*Result*
| year | Status | order_cnt | value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2014 | 1 | 224 | 3,873,579.0123 |

*Findings & Recommendations*
- Findings: In 2014, there were 224 pending orders totaling approximately $3.87 million in value -> This indicates a significant volume and monetary value stuck in the pending status, potentially delaying fulfillment and revenue recognition.
- Recommendations
  + Investigate causes of pending orders to identify and remove process bottlenecks
  + Streamline order processing workflows to reduce pending durations
  + Monitor pending order metrics regularly to prevent backlog buildup
  + Prioritize clearance of high-value pending orders to improve cash flow and customer satisfaction

### üí°Conclusion & Key Insights

Adventure Works is positioned for strong growth, driven by high-performing products and regions ‚Äî but to fully capitalize, the company must **tighten inventory control, boost customer retention, and streamline operations**.

* **Core products (Bikes, Frames, Apparel)** and **top regions (Territory 4, 6, 1)** are consistently leading in sales and growth ‚Üí *these are strategic anchors for future investment*.
